## CNN Spectra Classification
## A hybrid recognition model including an 8-class classiﬁcation model and a binary classiﬁcation model for LAMOST spectra classification and hot subdwarfs identiﬁcation.

Hot subdwarf star is a particular type of star that is crucial to studying binary evolution and atmospheric diﬀusion processes. In recent years, identifying Hot subdwarfs by machine learning methods has become a hot topic, but there are still limitations in automation and accuracy. 

In this work, we proposed a robust identiﬁcation method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). We ﬁrst constructed the dataset using the spectral data of LAMOS DR7-V1. We then constructed a hybrid recognition model including an 8-class classiﬁcation model and a binary classiﬁcation model. We used the model to ﬁlter and classify all 10,640,255 spectra of LAMOST DR7-V1, and obtained a catalog of 2393 Hot subdwarf candidates, of which 2067 have been conﬁrmed. We found 25 new Hot subdwarfs among the remaining candidates by manual validation. The overall accuracy of the model is 87.42%. 

Overall, the model presented in this study can eﬀectively identify speciﬁc spectra with robust results and high accuracy, and can be further applied to the classiﬁcation of large-scale spectra and search of speciﬁc targets.
